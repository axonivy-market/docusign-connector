                  <p>By embedding DocuSign functionality in your app, you can use its UI to initiate the signing process and enable your users to send or sign documents directly within your app, avoiding the need to switch contexts to email.</p>
                  <p>Per default it uses <a href="https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/concepts/embedding/" target="_blank">DocuSign JS</a> plugin.</p>
                HelpText: What we have in this section
                HelpTextDescription: DocuSign transactions can be initiated either remotely, via an email notification that directs signers to view or sign their documents through the DocuSign website, or performed directly within an application using embedded sending and embedded signing.

                RemoteSigningHelpText: |-
                  <p>This action demonstrates how to send a signature request via an email, also known as a remote signature request or remote signing. The email will contain a signing link that the recipient can use to open and electronically sign a document using the DocuSign mobile app or the DocuSign website.</p>
                  <p>After signing is complete, the recipient receives a carbon copy (CC) of the email that includes all of the completed and signed documents.</p>

                  <p>To use a native iframe tag for signing: it seems to be a simple and straightforward way to display the signing experience. However, using iframes can also lead to a web-page-within-web-page like user experience which can feel unintuitive. Additionally, some features such as Identity Verification are not compatible with iframes.</p>
